# WARNING: settings here screw up rabbitmqadmin commands which don't then respect the command line --host switch, leading to unintuitive Python socket timeouts
#
# eg. 192.168.99.100 was old docker machine address, but docker desktop now uses localhost, leading to rabbitmqadmin commands not working against docker containers
